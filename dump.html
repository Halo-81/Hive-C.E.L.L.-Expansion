<p>    --> <center>But even as shriveled as my power is, it's still more than enough that I needn't appear so weak in front of the other person in the room, who I can now hear muttering to herself and fussing about.</center></p>

<p></p>
<p>    -- `L I've summoned you to the mortal world, but the spell will only hold as long as I give it power.`</p>

<p>    --> `L And I want the Dean's office at the University as my absolute slaves, to dispose of as I see fit.`</p>
<p></p>
<p>    -- She has a malicious gleam in her eye that I find absolutely delightful. I like this Liana better by the moment. I can feel her power too - though much of it is tied up anchoring me in reality, there's <em>still</em> enough left to be impressive for a human.</p>

<p>    --> She grasps my wrist, and I ignore her surprised look, exploring the fabric she has on underneath.</p>
<p>    --> It's springy. Her shirt stretches too, most unnaturally. I frown at her.</p>

<p>    --> Even if she's pledged to my service, it would just be embarrassing if a servant overpowered me. I sneer at the \"bra\" and conjure a burst of flame to consume it. I can still do that much at least.</p>

<p>    --> I cradle her face gently in my hands and wake her up with a kiss. I liked her before, but I like her even better now that she's properly nude and sitting at my feet, rather than standing eye to eye.</p>

<p>    --> She blinks several times, as though I've said something incredibly foolish. I don't see why - I hate the cold.</p>
<p>    --> `L This isn't a kingdom, mistress. And everyone has a freezer. Um... look, maybe we can just leave that aside for now. What we really need to worry about is money. I've paid for another three days, but after that, my cards are maxed out, and I don't think you have a bank account.`</p>
<p>    --> I laugh. She looks so earnest, worrying about such a thing. And cute, too, with her breasts bobbing and cunt still dripping occasionally. I must be getting soft.</p>

<p>    -- We spend the next several hours going over a bit of local history and geography. "California" seems to be just one kingdom in a larger empire, the Yousa. But we're in a small, isolated town which might as well just be begging for conversion into my new stronghold. A couple of foreign wars, but nothing local. Perfect.</p>
<p>    --> I don't like those things called "cars," though, that she assures me everyone has. The local constables might be able to summon the king's army within a few days. Then they'd burn all my tentacle gardens and lock me up and make me wear a bra in prison. That would be terrible.</p>
<p></p>
</page><page><p><em> </em></p>
<p>    -- The first step, however, is clear enough. I need to establish a magical center, and to do that, I'll need some slaves. Liana's too valuable for that duty, and still needed to keep me from fading out of existence besides.</p>
<p>    --> Liana is a mage. I am a Dark Lady. We're staying in an inn (quite a large one, in fact). The task is trivial. I make one of the walls translucent to sight, then once we locate our targets, I rotate it out of existence entirely.</p>

Both of my new slaves collapse into a deep slumber. They won't wake up until we have a use for them. She steps into another room, and I hear her repeat the same spell.</p>
<p>    --> She borrows one of their voices, and speaks to a machine on the bedside table, then informs me that the room is now ours to for the rest of the week.</p>

<p>    --> I blink. She's a smarty, this one is. Less chance of any witnesses if he comes to us. But no, I'm tired of being cooped up in this room. I do grumble a bit as I pull on clothes. Though Liana has nothing that fits properly, at least one of her "T shirts" can stretch to cover my more ample bosom.</p>

<p>    --> `D Right. A bra.`</p>
<p>    -- `D You, slave, she's not to be without a cock inside her for twenty four hours.` I order one of my male slaves to attend to her. `D After that, you, bra-girl, return to the front desk. This place is closed for repairs until further notice. No more customers, but keep everything running like normal.`</p>
<p>    --> `D You can keep your shirt, since you'll be dealing with the outside world, but while you're behind that counter, no pants or underwear, ever.` Since I haven't actually mind controlled her, just added a hint of obedience and a pound of not-telling-anyone, I back my commands up with a threat. `D Anyone catches you with pants on inside this room, I'll make you work topless too.`</p>
<p></p>
<p>    -- Liana, perhaps sensing that I'm liable to keep ranting and raving and piling punishments on the hussy as long as that... thing... remains in my sight, banishes the bra with a spell.</p>

<p></p>
<p>    She needs another few years to grow into her power, but when the time comes... the ritual to stop aging is difficult. I think she'll be powerful enough, but not if I'm tying up three quarters of her magic.</p>

<p></p>
<p>    -- `D I've been intensely cautious in my approach, because by all rights we ought to have holy crusaders knocking down our doors by now, and I wanted to seem nothing more than a succubus or some such minor nonsense. But where are the gods and demon lords and sorcerers and saints? I can't find them. I don't know why.`</p>

I wouldn't normally worry too much, she can't have more than a dagger in there, but apparently the police in this day and age carry miniature crossbows or something? Liana made them sound pretty dangerous. That's still ok. She couldn't kill me.</p>
